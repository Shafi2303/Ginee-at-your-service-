# Ginee-at-your-service-
This project is a simple yet functional voice assistant built using Python. It leverages speech recognition to understand voice input from the user and uses a text-to-speech engine to respond with spoken feedback. The assistant listens to voice commands through a microphone, processes the input using Google's Speech Recognition API
